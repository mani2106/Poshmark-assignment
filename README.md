# Poshmark - Take-Home assignment
This repo consists of notebook with details on data exploration, modelling, evaluation, and a script to generate model-agnostic feature importances

[This link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W-cDB5202BWPEWpv66RISwcPYN-epaSr_kqMO3KqeiA/edit?usp=sharing) contains a presentation with overview of my approach and answering some questions that they asked.
